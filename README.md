# PDFJS minified Legacy (with viewer)

[PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) is a Portable Document Format
(PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5.

PDF.js is community-driven and supported by Mozilla. Its goal is to
create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for parsing and
rendering PDFs.

This is a pre-built version of the PDF.js source code, produced by running:
`gulp minified-legacy` against the upstream repo.

See https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js for learning and contributing.
